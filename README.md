> Warning: Cynos is still under active development and is not production-ready. APIs, crate boundaries, and performance characteristics may change.

Cynos is an embedded in-memory relational engine built for low-latency live queries, prepared execution, incremental maintenance, and efficient WASM/JS delivery.

Cynos is a Rust workspace for an in-memory relational engine, a rule/heuristic query planner, incremental dataflow, reactive subscriptions, and a WASM-backed JavaScript/TypeScript package.

The public JS package lives in `js/packages/core` as `@cynos/core`. The Rust crates are organized so the lower layers stay reusable and mostly `#![no_std]`, while the host-facing WASM and benchmark crates depend on a full runtime.

## What Exists Today

- In-memory row storage with schema enforcement, primary-key lookups, secondary B+Tree indexes, and JSONB-oriented GIN indexes.
- Rule/heuristic query planning with predicate pushdown, implicit join recognition, join reordering by row-count estimates, index selection, TopN pushdown, order-by-index rewriting, limit/offset pushdown into scans, and cached compiled execution artifacts.
- Reactive query APIs with three distinct modes:
  - `observe()`: cached query execution, callback receives the full current result set when it changes.
  - `changes()`: cached query execution, callback receives the full current result set immediately and on later changes.
  - `trace()`: incremental view maintenance (IVM), callback receives `{ added, removed }` deltas for incrementalizable queries.
- Prepared query handles via `prepare()`, which reuse the compiled physical plan and expose `exec()`, `execBinary()`, and `getSchemaLayout()` for repeated execution.
- Compiled single-table execution fast paths that can fuse scan/filter/project work and apply row-local reactive patches for simple subscriptions instead of always re-running the full query.
- Binary query results via `execBinary()` + `getSchemaLayout()` + `ResultSet` for low-overhead WASM-to-JS transfer.
- JSONB building blocks including a compact binary codec, a JSONPath subset parser/evaluator, JSONB operators, and extraction helpers for GIN indexing.
- Journaled in-memory transactions with commit/rollback APIs.

## Advantages

Cynos is designed for embedded, query-heavy applications where the hot working set lives in memory and live queries are part of the runtime, not layered on later.

That gives it a different design target from SQLite, RxDB, and PGlite:

| Compared with | Better known for | Cynos is typically stronger when... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQLite | Durable embedded SQL storage, broad compatibility, and tiny operational footprint | the data is already memory-resident and engine-native live queries or low-overhead WASM result delivery matter more than persistence |
| RxDB | Local-first sync, reactive document collections, `RxQuery`, query cache, and EventReduce-based updates | the workload needs relational joins, aggregates, JSONB-style querying, and reactive delivery from one execution engine |
| PGlite | PostgreSQL compatibility in WASM with ecosystem reuse | a tighter embedded execution path and purpose-built reactive APIs matter more than PostgreSQL compatibility |

Core advantages:

- Live queries are first-class: `observe()` / `changes()` return full current results, while `trace()` returns DBSP-style `{ added, removed }` deltas.
- Hot paths are compiled and cached: physical plans, execution artifacts, fused single-table fast paths, and row-local reactive patching reduce repeat-query overhead.
- The WASM/JS boundary is optimized too: `execBinary()` plus `SchemaLayout` can avoid most JS object materialization cost on larger results.
- The workspace stays modular: storage, planner, indexes, JSONB, incremental dataflow, and host bindings are separated, with lower layers kept largely `no_std + alloc` friendly.

Representative recent local measurements, on Node.js + WASM with both 10K and 100K row/document datasets, are shown below as workload-specific reference points rather than universal claims. The main relational table uses aligned semantics across Cynos, PGlite, and SQLite: prepared query reuse plus full JS object materialization.

| Workload | Cynos | Representative comparison | What it suggests |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Point lookup (`id` near the 90th percentile) | `0.013 ms` at 10K, `0.006 ms` at 100K | PGlite `0.209 ms` at 10K, `1.35 ms` at 100K; SQLite `0.020 ms` at 10K, `0.012 ms` at 100K | Cynos is already very competitive on repeated embedded reads, not only on subscriptions |
| Relational join (`users JOIN departments ... LIMIT 1000`) | `6.10 ms` at 10K, `6.37 ms` at 100K | PGlite `8.11 ms` at 10K, `10.60 ms` at 100K; SQLite `3.22 ms` at 10K, `5.07 ms` at 100K | Cynos is competitive on embedded relational work while staying purpose-built for reactive delivery |
| Wide scan (`LIMIT 5000`) via object rows vs `execBinary()` only | `16.45 ms -> 0.836 ms` at 10K, `17.16 ms -> 0.810 ms` at 100K | same Cynos query, different transport/materialization path | The WASM/JS boundary is a major part of end-to-end cost, and `execBinary()` remains one of Cynos's clearest advantages |
| Live update latency | `changes(): 0.353 ms`, `trace(): 0.021 ms` at 10K; `changes(): 4.35 ms`, `trace(): 0.031 ms` at 100K | PGlite live query `2.63 ms` at 10K, `9.69 ms` at 100K | Cynos is especially strong when live queries are part of the hot path, and `trace()` stays close to constant here |
| JSON filter (`metadata.category = tech LIMIT 100`) | `0.229 ms` at 10K, `0.483 ms` at 100K | PGlite `0.760 ms` at 10K, `1.76 ms` at 100K; SQLite `0.219 ms` at 10K, `0.282 ms` at 100K | Cynos already handles structured JSON predicates in the same practical range as embedded SQL/WASM peers |
| Mutation-driven requery (`insert + complex JSON query`) | `0.318 ms` at 10K, `0.326 ms` at 100K | PGlite `0.422 ms` at 10K, `0.637 ms` at 100K; SQLite `0.118 ms` at 10K, `0.205 ms` at 100K | Cynos's re-query path remains competitive even when the query includes nested JSON predicates and ordering |

A few important caveats to keep the comparison fair:

- In the same local harness, SQLite (`sql.js`) remained faster on some wide scans, aggregate-heavy paths, and several JSON query shapes.
- RxDB remained faster on warm cached document reads; Cynos's advantage is the unified relational + JSONB + reactive engine, not cache-hit document lookup latency alone.
- The benchmark now separates "prepared query + object rows" from lower-overhead array/binary paths, because otherwise result materialization can dominate the comparison and blur what is actually executor cost.
- On the current 10K/100K document benchmark, Cynos's metadata index is still workload-sensitive: it helps some 10K JSON filters materially, but the current 100K compound/indexed paths are not yet wins and remain useful optimizer/index-planning regression checks.
- PGlite remains the better fit when PostgreSQL compatibility and ecosystem reuse are the primary requirements.

The cross-engine WASM comparison harness that produced these numbers lives in `scripts/engine_compare.mjs` and currently runs both 10K and 100K scenarios with aligned prepared-query semantics for the main relational comparisons.

Best fit:

- in-memory dashboards, local analytics, collaborative views, and client-side derived state;
- browser / edge / WASM applications where query latency and JS materialization cost both matter;
- workloads that repeatedly execute the same query shapes and benefit from cached execution or incremental maintenance.

Less ideal when durability, SQL compatibility, or sync ecosystem breadth matter more than in-memory reactive performance:

- choose SQLite when durable embedded SQL storage is the main requirement;
- choose RxDB when offline sync and document-centric replication are the main requirement;
- choose PGlite when PostgreSQL compatibility in WASM is the main requirement.

## Architecture Overview

At a high level, Cynos is layered so the storage, planning, incremental, and host-facing pieces stay separable:

```text
Application code
  -> @cynos/core (js/packages/core)
      -> cynos-database (wasm-bindgen host API)
          -> cynos-query        -> logical plan / physical plan / executors
          -> cynos-storage      -> row store / constraints / transaction journal
          -> cynos-index        -> B+Tree / hash / GIN primitives
          -> cynos-jsonb        -> JSONB values / JSONPath / operators / key extraction
          -> cynos-binary       -> compact result encoding for WASM -> JS
          -> cynos-incremental  -> incremental dataflow for eligible plans
          -> cynos-reactive     -> subscriptions on top of incremental views
```

Operationally there are two query delivery paths:

1. Cached execution path:
   - `SelectBuilder` produces a logical plan.
   - `cynos-query` rewrites and lowers it to a physical plan plus a cached `PlanExecutionArtifact`.
   - The compiled artifact runs against `cynos-storage`, using fused single-table fast paths where possible and a compiled executor elsewhere.
   - `observe()` / `changes()` reuse that cached artifact. For simple single-table pipelines without blocking operators, the reactive layer can patch the current result in place from `changed_ids` instead of forcing a full re-execution.
   - Results are delivered either as JS objects or as a binary buffer decoded by `ResultSet`.
2. Incremental path:
   - If `PhysicalPlan::is_incrementalizable()` is true, `cynos-database` lowers the plan into `cynos-incremental` dataflow.
   - `cynos-reactive` subscribes to the materialized view and emits row-level deltas.
   - If the plan is not incrementalizable, callers should use the cached execution APIs instead.

Cross-cutting responsibilities:

- `cynos-core` defines the shared schema/value/error model used everywhere else.
- `cynos-jsonb` feeds both query semantics and GIN-style indexing.
- `cynos-perf` exercises the full stack with custom benchmark scenarios.

## JavaScript / TypeScript Quick Start

```ts
import {
  ColumnOptions,
  JsDataType,
  col,
  createDatabase,
  initCynos,
} from '@cynos/core';

await initCynos();
const db = createDatabase('demo');

const users = db.createTable('users')
  .column('id', JsDataType.Int64, new ColumnOptions().primaryKey(true))
  .column('name', JsDataType.String)
  .column('age', JsDataType.Int32)
  .index('idx_age', 'age');

db.registerTable(users);

await db.insert('users').values([
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', age: 30 },
]).exec();

const rows = await db
  .select('*')
  .from('users')
  .where(col('age').gt(25))
  .exec();

console.log(rows);
```

Notes:

- Table builders must be passed to `db.registerTable(...)`. Calling `createTable(...).column(...);` alone does not install the schema.
- `select()` accepts `'*'`, a single column name, an array of column names, or multiple variadic column arguments.
- `prepare()` returns a reusable handle with `exec()`, `execBinary()`, and `getSchemaLayout()` when the same query shape runs repeatedly.
- For joins, use column references on both sides, for example `col('orders.user_id').eq(col('users.id'))`.

## Reactive Modes

| API | Callback payload | Best for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `observe()` | Full current result set | Imperative listeners that can fetch the initial state manually | No initial callback; call `getResult()` first if needed. Uses cached execution artifacts and may patch simple single-table results in place |
| `changes()` | Full current result set | UI state updates such as React `setState` | Emits the initial result immediately. Uses the same cached execution path as `observe()` |
| `trace()` | `{ added, removed }` delta object | Incremental UIs or downstream consumers that want O(delta) updates | Only works for incrementalizable plans; `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, and other non-streamable operators fall back to `observe()`/`changes()` |

```ts
import { col } from '@cynos/core';

const stream = db
  .select('*')
  .from('users')
  .where(col('age').gte(18))
  .changes();

const stopStream = stream.subscribe((currentRows) => {
  console.log('current result', currentRows);
});

const trace = db
  .select('*')
  .from('users')
  .where(col('age').gte(18))
  .trace();

console.log('initial trace result', trace.getResult());

const stopTrace = trace.subscribe((delta) => {
  console.log('added', delta.added);
  console.log('removed', delta.removed);
});
```

## DBSP-Style IVM

`trace()` is Cynos's DBSP-style incremental view maintenance path. It is not a separate query language; it reuses the normal planner pipeline and then lowers an eligible physical plan into a delta-oriented dataflow graph.

`observe()` / `changes()` now cover an important middle ground: they still expose full-result semantics, but simple single-table subscriptions can avoid full re-query work by applying row-local patches through the cached execution artifact.

How it works today:

1. Build the normal logical plan from the query builder.
2. Run the regular planner/optimizer pipeline and produce a physical plan.
3. Execute that physical plan once to bootstrap the initial result.
4. If `PhysicalPlan::is_incrementalizable()` is true, compile the plan into `cynos-incremental::DataflowNode`.
5. Route table-level `Delta<Row>` updates through `cynos-reactive::ObservableQuery`, which emits `{ added, removed }` changes to subscribers.

That design means the incremental path shares the same query-building surface as the re-query path, but uses a different maintenance strategy after the initial snapshot.

Current capabilities that are grounded in the implemented compiler/runtime:

- Incrementalizable scan family: table scans, index scans/gets, `IN` index gets, and GIN scan variants can participate in the bootstrap plan and dependency graph.
- Incrementalizable relational operators: filter, projection, map-style computed projections, joins, cross product, and hash aggregate.
- Current aggregate coverage on the incremental path: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.
- `MIN` and `MAX` are maintained with ordered multisets internally, so deletes do not force a full recomputation of the group.
- Join plans are lowered into incremental join state, so multi-table live queries can stay on the delta path when the rest of the plan is eligible.

Current boundaries:

- `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `TopN` are explicit blockers for `trace()`.
- When a query cannot be incrementalized, `trace()` returns an error and the caller should use `observe()` or `changes()` instead.
- The callback payload is a delta object, not a fully materialized result set, so consumers must maintain local state or re-read with `getResult()`.

## Choosing A Live Query Strategy

Cynos intentionally exposes two live-query families because they optimize for different things.

| Strategy | API | Strengths | Tradeoffs | Good fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cached full-result path | `observe()` / `changes()` | Works with the full query surface, easy to consume, always delivers the full current state, naturally fits UI state setters, and can use row-local patching for simple single-table subscriptions | Still ships full current results to subscribers; complex plans may still fall back to deterministic re-execution and full result comparison | Dashboards, CRUD tables, simple filtered lists, queries with `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT`, correctness-first integrations |
| Incremental plan | `trace()` | Reuses the planned query shape but propagates deltas after bootstrap; lower steady-state cost on frequent writes; payload is small when output churn is small | Restricted to incrementalizable plans; consumer must apply `{ added, removed }`; less convenient for naive UI binding | High-frequency subscriptions, collaborative/live views, pipelines where the query is mostly filter/join/group-by without ordering/windowing |

Practical guidance:

- Use `changes()` when you want the simplest "always give me the current rows" API, especially in React/Vue-style state updates.
- Use `observe()` when you want the same re-query semantics but prefer to fetch the initial state manually.
- Use `trace()` when the query stays within the supported incremental subset and update frequency is high enough that even the cached full-result path becomes the bottleneck, or when you explicitly want row-level deltas.
- If you need sorted, paginated, or otherwise non-streamable output, treat the cached full-result path as the default strategy.

## Local Bench Snapshot

To make this tradeoff less abstract, benchmarks were conducted natively at the Rust layer on a Mac mini M4, before cross-compilation to WASM. The absolute numbers will differ in WASM environments (browsers, runtimes), but the relative performance characteristics shown here reflect the underlying algorithmic tradeoffs.

```bash
cargo bench -p cynos-database --bench requery_microbench
```

Recent `requery_microbench` runs show the current cached execution path behaves very differently depending on the query shape. The `observe()` / `changes()` APIs are still full-result APIs, but simple single-table subscriptions now use a row-local patch path instead of a forced full re-query on every change.

| Scenario | 10K rows | 100K rows | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `single_query_filter_execute` | `226.85 us` | `6.07 ms` | Compiled single-query execution |
| `requery_observe_create` | `318.29 us` | `7.02 ms` | Initial snapshot + subscription setup |
| `requery_on_change/result_changes` | `925 ns` | `1.27 us` | Simple single-table filter, row-local patch path |
| `requery_on_change/result_unchanged` | `810 ns` | `812 ns` | Same shape, unchanged result |
| `requery_on_change_filter_project_limit/result_changes` | `19.71 us` | `17.98 us` | `LIMIT` keeps this on the generic cached execution path |
| `requery_on_change_compound_filter/result_changes` | `948 ns` | `1.31 us` | Compound single-table filter still benefits from row-local patching |

What these numbers mean in practice:

- Initial query execution still costs what you would expect for a compiled in-memory query over 10K / 100K rows.
- Simple single-table live queries are now much cheaper on steady-state updates because the engine can patch only the touched rows into the current result.
- Blocking operators such as `LIMIT` still matter: they can keep a subscription on the generic cached execution path even when the rest of the query is simple.
- `trace()` remains the true delta-native API for joins, grouped subscriptions, and consumers that want `{ added, removed }` rather than a refreshed full result.

Important caveats:

- These are Rust-side harness numbers, not browser end-to-end UI timings.
- The `requery_on_change` rows above are no longer measuring a forced full re-query for simple single-table plans; they measure the current reactive update path, which may use row-local patching.
- The callback payload for `observe()` / `changes()` is still the full current result set even when the engine-side maintenance work is tiny.
- If your real UI needs sorted/paginated output, or the query shape is multi-table / aggregate-heavy, the generic cached path or `trace()` may still be the better mental model than the single-table patch fast path.

## Complexity At A Glance

These are the typical asymptotics for the current implementation, not hard real-time guarantees:

| Area | Typical cost | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary-key / B+Tree lookup | `O(log n)` | Backed by `RowStore` + B+Tree indexes |
| B+Tree range scan | `O(log n + k)` | `k` is the number of returned row IDs |
| Standalone hash-index lookup | Average `O(1)` | Implemented in `cynos-index`, but not the default secondary-index path in `RowStore` today |
| GIN-style key lookup | Proportional to extracted keys + posting-list work | Best thought of as inverted-index style rather than a plain `O(1)` hash lookup |
| `observe()` / `changes()` simple single-table path | Roughly `O(changed_rows * per-row filter/project) + O(log r)` | Applies row-local patches into the current result when the plan is a patchable single-table pipeline |
| `observe()` / `changes()` generic path | Re-executes the cached plan and compares/materializes the current result | Used for joins, aggregates, `LIMIT`, sorting, and any plan outside the patchable subset |
| `trace()` | `O(Δoutput)` delivery after incremental compilation | Only for plans that can be lowered to incremental dataflow |
| Incremental `COUNT` / `SUM` / `AVG` | `O(Δinput)` over affected groups | Maintains running aggregate state |
| Incremental `MIN` / `MAX` | `O(log group_size)` per delta | Implemented with ordered multisets in `cynos-incremental` |

## Binary Results

The JS package can read query results through a compact binary buffer instead of JSON object materialization.

```ts
import { ResultSet } from '@cynos/core';

const query = db.select('*').from('users');
const layout = query.getSchemaLayout();
const buffer = await query.execBinary();

const rs = new ResultSet(buffer, layout);
console.log(rs.length);
console.log(rs.getString(0, 1));

const materialized = rs.toArray();
rs.free();
```

Implementation details:

- The binary format is row-major with a 16-byte header plus a fixed-width section and a variable-width section.
- `Int64` and `DateTime` are encoded as `f64` values in the binary payload for JS interop.
- `ResultSet` uses a compiled decoder when `new Function()` is allowed and falls back to an interpreted path under stricter CSP settings.

## Rust Quick Start

```rust
use cynos_core::schema::TableBuilder;
use cynos_core::{DataType, Row, Value};
use cynos_storage::RowStore;

fn main() -> cynos_core::Result<()> {
    let schema = TableBuilder::new("users")?
        .add_column("id", DataType::Int64)?
        .add_column("name", DataType::String)?
        .add_primary_key(&["id"], false)?
        .build()?;

    let mut store = RowStore::new(schema);
    store.insert(Row::new(
        1,
        vec![Value::Int64(1), Value::String("Alice".into())],
    ))?;

    assert_eq!(store.len(), 1);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Build And Test

```bash
# Rust workspace
cargo test --workspace

# Benchmark binary
cargo run -p cynos-perf --release

# Raw WASM build for the database crate
cd crates/database
wasm-pack build --target web

# JS package workspace
cd ../../js
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## Browser / Runtime Compatibility

Compilation to WASM and execution in browser-like environments are first-class features of cynos. To provide a complete picture, this section presents additional compatibility data.

The current JS package and generated glue code rely on these platform features:

| Capability | Where it is used | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WebAssembly` | Loading and instantiating `cynos.wasm` | Required |
| `Promise` | `initCynos()` and async query APIs | Required |
| `TypedArray` / `DataView` | Binary protocol and WASM memory access | Required |
| `TextDecoder` | String and JSONB decoding | Required |
| `BigInt` | Exact `Int64` inputs outside the JS safe-integer range | Optional for basic usage, required for precise 64-bit literals |
| `new Function()` | Fast compiled decoder in `ResultSet` | Optional; there is an interpreted fallback |

Notes:

- The generated wasm-bindgen loader already falls back from `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(...)` to byte-buffer instantiation when streaming or MIME setup is unavailable.
- The current WASM target does not depend on threads or SIMD-specific browser features.
- `@cynos/core` is ESM-first and targets modern browsers plus recent Node.js runtimes with standard WebAssembly APIs.

## Current Limits

- Cynos is in-memory only. There is no durable on-disk storage engine yet.
- Transactions are journaled commit/rollback over in-memory state; this is not durable storage in the traditional ACID database sense.
- `trace()` only works for plans that the physical planner can lower to incremental dataflow.
- Storage/query integration currently materializes B+Tree and GIN indexes from schema definitions. A standalone hash index implementation also exists in the workspace, but it is not the default secondary-index path in `RowStore` today.
- JavaScript `Int64` values are exposed through JS-friendly paths as numbers, so values outside the safe integer range lose precision unless the calling pattern is designed around that limitation.
